              <p>
                With temperatures clocking in at 45â„ƒ, conducting classes online
                mitigates health risks such as sun strokes, nosebleeds and dizziness, ensuring the safety
                and continuity of learning.

              <p>
                Public transport systems are overflowing with passengers turning
                every journey into a struggle. Additionally missing out on our
                designated mode of transport sets us back.

              <h3>Dehydration Risk</h3>
              <p>
                As the temperature rises, so does the risk of dehydration.
                Excessive heat drains energy levels, leaving us weary and
                dehydrated during transport and classes.

                In response to the sweltering heatwave sweeping the nation, the
                government has already taken decisive action by declaring a
                holiday and initiating online classes.

              <h3>Cutting Carbon Footprint</h3>
              <p>
                Using air conditioning contributes to increased energy
                consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Students can help
                lower their carbon footprint by reducing the use of
                transportation fuels.
